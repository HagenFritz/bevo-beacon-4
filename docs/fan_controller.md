# BEVO Beacon V4 PWM Fan Controller Documentation

## Overview

The BEVO Beacon V4 uses a single-transistor PWM fan controller to provide precise airflow control for indoor air quality monitoring. This system enables controlled air sampling through the sensor chamber, addressing thermal management and measurement accuracy issues from the original BEVO Beacon design.

## Circuit Design

### Architecture
- **Single BJT transistor design** using 2N2222A for simplicity and reliability
- **PWM-based speed control** from Raspberry Pi GPIO18
- **Smart startup sequence** to overcome motor starting torque limitations
- **40%-100% speed control range** achieved through kick-start methodology

### Key Innovation
The controller implements a "kick-start" approach where the fan is briefly powered to 100% before ramping down to target speeds. This overcomes the static friction limitations common in small DC fans, enabling reliable operation down to 40% duty cycle.

## Software Implementation

### Smart Fan Controller Class

The implementation includes a `SmartFanController` class with the following key methods:

#### Startup Sequence
```python
def startup_sequence(self):
    # Quick ramp to 100% to overcome starting torque
    for duty in range(0, 101, 20):
        self.pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(duty)
        time.sleep(0.1)
    
    # Hold at 100% briefly to ensure stable rotation
    time.sleep(1)
    self.is_running = True
```

#### Speed Control with Automatic Startup
```python
def set_speed(self, target_speed):
    # Handle startup from stopped state
    if not self.is_running and target_speed > 0:
        self.startup_sequence()
    
    # Smooth ramp to target speed
    # Implementation handles both ramp up and ramp down
```

### Integration with BEVO Beacon V4
This fan controller enables the controlled airflow architecture critical for sensor accuracy:

#### Sequential Sensor Exposure
The controlled airflow ensures air moves through sensors in this order:
1. **CO₂ sensor** (SenseAir S8)
2. **PM2.5 sensor** (Honeywell HPMA115S0)
3. **Formaldehyde sensor** (Sensirion SFA30)
4. **TVOC/NOx sensor** (Sensirion SGP41)

## Integration Notes

### Next Development Steps
1. **Airflow Characterization:** Measure actual CFM at different PWM settings

- **Current margin:** Adequate headroom for sensor integration

### Mechanical Integration
- **Fan mounting:** Designed for integration with 3D printed sensor chamber
